<p>
The above is a view of the grand screen and entrance lodges to Burleigh,
or Burghley, the seat of the Cecil family, and now the property of the
Marquess of Exeter. The house and principal part of the demesne, are
within the parish of Stamford St. Martin, in the church of which are
some costly monuments to several eminent persons of the Cecil family;
and this estate gave title to William Cecil, Baron Burleigh, in 1570.
The park was formed, and the mansion, which is one of the most splendid
in the kingdom, was mostly built by the great Lord Treasurer, in the
time of Queen Elizabeth, and the following inscription, over one of the
entrances, within a central court, records the era of this work:&mdash;"W.
DOM. DE BVRGHLEY, 1577." Beneath the turret is the date of 1585, when
some grand additions were made to the mansion; and the above Grand
Entrance, towards the north, appears to have been added in 1587. Since
these dates, several material alterations and additions have been made
by subsequent possessors; and the whole, as a building, with its vast
and varied collection of works of art, is one of the most magnificent
show-houses in England. The spacious and finely wooded park and large
lake are also very fine. The house surrounds a square court, to the east
of which is the great hall, kitchen, various domestic offices, with
spacious stables, coach-houses, &amp;c.&mdash;all indicative of the splendid
hospitalities of the Elizabethean age and old English character. The
south front commands a fine sloping lawn, with a broad sheet of water,
formed by Brown, together with some interesting park-scenery; the
western side has nearly the same views, with the advantage of distant
objects in Rutlandshire, Lincolnshire, and the spires of Stamford. From
the north front the ground gradually slopes to the river Welland. A
complete list of the pictures and valuable curiosities of Burleigh will
be found in a Guide published by the ingenious Mr. Drakard, bookseller,
of Stamford, as well as in that gentleman's excellent <i>History of
Stamford</i>.
</p><p>
About two miles west of Burleigh, are the ruins of Wothorp, or Worthorp
House. According to Camden, a mansion
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page290" name="page290"></a>[pg 290]</span>
of considerable size was erected
here by Thomas Cecil, the first Earl of Burleigh, who jocularly said,
"he built it only to retire to out of the dust, while his great house at
Burleigh was sweeping." After the Restoration the Duke of Buckingham
resided here for some years.</p>

<h3>
CALCULATING CHILD.</h3>

<center>
(<i>Translated from the last number of the Revue Encyclopedique. By a
Correspondent</i>.)</center>
<h4>
(<i>For the Mirror</i>.)</h4>

<p>
A boy, seven years of age, whose name is Vincent Zuccaro, has excited
the public attention at Palermo for some time past. This child, born of
poor and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page291" name="page291"></a>[pg 291]</span>
          uneducated parents, possesses an extraordinary talent for
calculation; his mind seizes, as it were, by instinct, all the varied
combinations of numbers, which he unravels with equal facility. The
various reports which had been spread throughout the city, respecting
his talents, appeared so incredible, that a public meeting of literary
men was expressly convened, for the purpose of examining his
pretensions. The meeting was held on the 30th of January last, at the
Academy <i>Del Buon Gusto</i>, and consisted of upwards of four hundred
persons, among whom were observed some of the most distinguished
literati and influential persons of the city. Two Professors of
Mathematics were stationed near the child, to prevent collusion or
fraud, and to take minutes of the questions proposed, with the answers
returned. A great number of questions were proposed, which Vincent
Zuccaro answered with a facility that excited general admiration. We
shall only extract two of the most simple, as some of the questions
would be hardly intelligible to general readers:
</p><p>
Question 1.&mdash;A ship set sail at noon from Naples to Palermo (the
distance between the two cities being 180 miles), and sailed at the rate
of ten miles an hour; another ship set off at the same time, to sail
from Palermo to Naples, at the rate of seven miles per hour: at what
time did the ships meet each other, and what was the distance sailed by
each? Vincent Zuccaro immediately replied&mdash;The first ship sailed 105
15/17 miles; the second, 74 2/17 miles. It was then observed to him,
that he had only answered part of the question, and that the hour of
meeting had been omitted. He then said this would be 10 10-17 hours
after the time of the departure. The child had perceived that this part
of the answer was implicitly contained in the former; which he also
imagined the examiners perceived as well as himself, and therefore he
omitted it.
</p><p>
Question 2.&mdash;In three successive attacks upon a town, a quarter of the
assailants perished in the first attack, a fifth in the second, and a
sixth in the last, when their number was reduced to 138 men. Required
the original number? Answer, 360.
</p><p>
Q.&mdash;How did you find that number?
</p><p>
A.&mdash;If the number had been 60, there would eventually have remained 23;
now 23 being the sixth of 138, the assailants were 6 times 60 or 360 at
first.
</p><p>
Q.&mdash;Why did you suppose the number 60, rather than 50 or 70?
</p><p>
A.&mdash;Because neither 50 nor 70 are divisible by 4 or 6.
</p><p>
From these questions and replies, it will be readily understood that the
child does not employ the ordinary artifices of mathematicians. Marquess
Scriso, who was the first person to discover this singular talent, is
about, with several other persons of distinction in the city, to solicit
the aid of Government in the education of the child, every one being
fully aware of the impropriety of subjecting him to the ordinary mode of
education.

<h3>
ANCIENT HISTORY OF DRURY LANE.</h3>
<h4>
(<i>For the Mirror.</i>)</h4>

<p>
The reader will most probably exclaim, "Ancient History of Drury Lane!
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page292" name="page292"></a>[pg 292]</span>
What a farce!" A dirty lane filled with all complexions of hawkers and
pedlars, licensed and unlicensed!&mdash;true incurious reader, Gay has sung
</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
  <p><i>"Of Drury's mazy courts and dark abodes;"</i></p>
</div></div>
<p>
yet the topographical and theatrical loiterer may call to mind many
<i>pleasing</i> reminiscences, although mingled with <i>unpleasing
ones</i>:</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>  "Who has not here a watch or snuff-box lost,</p>
<p>  Or handkerchiefs that India's shuttle boast."</p>
</div></div><h4>
GAY.</h4>

<p>
Stowe says, "Drury Lane, so called, for that there is a house belonging
to the family of the Druries.<a id="footnotetag1" name="footnotetag1"></a><a href="#footnote1"><sup>1</sup></a> This lane turneth north towards S.
Giles in the field. From the south end of this lane in the high street,
are divers faire buildings, hostelries, and houses for gentlemen, and
men of honor, &amp;c."</p>

<p>
Nightingale tells us, "The west end of Wych Street was formerly
ornamented by Drury House, built by Sir William Drury, an able commander
in the Irish wars, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and who
unfortunately fell in a duel with Sir John Burroughs, through a foolish
quarrel about precedency. During the time of the fatal discontents of
Elizabeth's favourite, the Earl of Essex, it was the place where his
imprudent advisers resolved on such counsels, as terminated in the
destruction of him and his adherents. In the next century it was
possessed by the heroic Earl of Craven, who rebuilt it. It was lately a
large brick pile, concealed by other buildings and was a public-house,
bearing the sign of the Queen of Bohemia's Head, the earl's admired
mistress, whose battles he fought animated by love and duty. When he
could aspire to her hand, he is supposed to have succeeded, and it is
said, that they were privately married; and that he built for her the
fine seat at Hampstead Marshal, in the county of Berks, afterwards
destroyed by fire. The services rendered by the earl to London, his
native city, in particular, were exemplary. He was so indefatigable in
preventing the ravages of the frequent fires of those days, that it was
said his very horse smelt it out. He and Monk, Duke of Albemarle,<a id="footnotetag2" name="footnotetag2"></a><a href="#footnote2"><sup>2</sup></a>
heroically staid in town during the dreadful pestilence, and at the
hazard of their lives preserved order in the midst of the terror of the
times." The house was taken down, and the ground purchased by Mr. Philip
Astley, who built there the Olympic Pavilion. In Craven Buildings there
was formerly a very good portrait of the Earl of Craven in armour, with
a truncheon in his hand, and mounted on his white horse. The Theatre
Royal in this street, originated on the Restoration. "The king made a
grant of a patent (says Pennant) for acting in what was then called the
Cockpit, and the Phoenix, the actors were the king's servants, were on
the establishment, and ten of them were called gentlemen of the Great
Chamber, and had ten yards of scarlet cloth allowed them, with a
suitable quantity of lace."</p>

<p>
There is a curious specimen of ancient architecture at the sign of the
Cock and Magpie public-house, facing Craven Buildings. Smith, in his
<i>London</i>, says, "The late Mr. Thomas Batrich, barber, of Drury
Lane, (who died in 1815, aged 85 years,) informed me that Theophilus
Cibber was the author of many of the prize-fighting bills, and that he
frequently attended and encouraged his favourites. It may be here
observed, that Drury Lane had seldom less than seven fights on a Sunday
morning, all going on at the same time on distinct spots." At present,
the fights are between the apple-women and the dogberries, respecting
the <i>legal tenure of stalls</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>  "Bess Hoy first found it troublesome to bawl,</p>
<p>  And therefore plac'd her cherries on a <i>stall</i>."</p>
</div></div>
<h4>
KING.</h4>

<p>
Drury Lane will always be interesting to the theatrical loiterer,
from the number of <i>stars</i> that have <i>irradiated</i> from its
<i>horizon</i>. If the wise Solon had lived in our times, he would no
doubt have felt a local attachment to this neighbourhood; for he
frequented plays even in the decline of life. And Plutarch informs us,
he thought plays useful to polish the manners, and instil the principles
of virtue.</p>

<p>
The association of the line&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>  In wit a man, simplicity a child&mdash;</p>
</div></div>
<p>
is so happy as to be applicable to the Poet of all Nature. It expresses
as much, if not more merit, than any single line often quoted, and its
frequent repetition has probably induced us to consider the latter
half&mdash;"simplicity a child"&mdash;as the peculiar talent of writing for
young people, aimed at by many, yet accomplished by so few. What is it
that so delights the young reader&mdash;we may say ourselves&mdash;in Robinson
Crusoe<a id="footnotetag3" name="footnotetag3"></a><a href="#footnote3"><sup>3</sup></a>&mdash;the Shakspeare of the play-ground&mdash;but <i>simplicity;</i>
and where, among the thousands of nursery books that have since been
written, can we find its match? In childhood, youth, manhood, and old
age, this is the great charm of life; and even the vitiated appetite is
not unfrequently coaxed into amendment by its very delightful character
when contrasted with coarser enjoyments. Metaphysicians deal out this
fact to the world over and over again, and all the philosophy of Locke,
Newton, and Bacon would be of little worth without it.
</p>

<p>
But this is too philosophical a strain for noticing a child's book&mdash;a
little volume that is among books what a child is in human nature&mdash;"man
in a small letter;" and such is Mrs. Watt's "New Year's Gift." To
express all the kindly feelings which it must produce in a mind occupied
as ours often is with graver matters&mdash;would be only to repeat what we
said a fortnight since; and so without further premise, we will open
this little casket of gems for the reader. We shall not string names
together, but take a few of them. First, the "Sisters of Scio," a true
story, by the author of "Constantinople in 1828," of two little Greek
girls being saved from the Turks, by a good Christian. Next is "The
Recall," by Mrs. Hemans:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>  Music is sorrowful</p>
<p class="i2">Since thou wert gone;</p>
<p>  Sisters are mourning thee&mdash;</p>
<p class="i2">Come to thine own</p>
<p>  Hark! the home voices call,</p>
<p class="i2">Back to thy rest!</p>
<p>  Come to thy father's hall,</p>
<p class="i2">Thy mother's breast!</p>
<p>  O'er the far blue mountains,</p>
<p class="i2">O'er the white sea-foam,</p>
<p>  Come, thou long parted one!</p>
<p class="i2">Back to thy home!</p>
</div></div>
<p>
&mdash;How appropriate is the story and its sequel; nay, almost as good as
two of Mr. Farley's pantomime scenes at Christmas. "The Miller's
Daughter," a tale of the French Revolution, which follows, is hardly so
fit: even the mention of Robespierre and the Reign of Terror chills
one's blood. "The Sights of London," is a string of "City Scenes" in
verse; and "May Maxwell," and "The Broken Pitcher," are pretty ballads,
by the Howitts. We are not half through the book, and can only mention
"the Young Governess," a school story&mdash;"the Birds and the Beggar of
Bagdad," a fairy tale&mdash;"Lady Lucy's Petition," an historiette&mdash;"the
Restless Boy," by Mrs. Opie, and the "Passionate Little Girl," by Mrs.
Hofland&mdash;all sparkling trifles in prose. Among the poetry is "the
African Mier-Vark," or Ant-eater, by Mr. Pringle, and "the Deadly
Nightshade," a sweetly touching ballad, dated from Florence; "the
Vulture of the Alps" is of similar character; and we are much pleased
with some lines on Birds, by Barry Cornwall, one set of which we copy,
the best prose papers being too long for extract:</p>

<h3>
EDIE OCHILTREE.</h3>

<center>
<i>From the New Edition of "The Antiquary."</i></center>

<p>
Of the "blue gowns," or king's bedesmen, from whom the character of Edie
Ochiltree was drawn, after giving an account from Martin's "Reliquiae
Divi Sancti Andrae," of an order of beggars in Scotland, supposed to
have descended from the ancient bards, and existing in Scotland in the
seventeenth century, but now extinct, Sir Walter Scott says:&mdash;
</p><p>
"The old remembered beggar, even in my own time, like the Baccoch, or
travelling cripple of Ireland, was expected to merit his quarters by
something beyond an exposition of his distresses. He was often a
talkative, facetious fellow, prompt at repartee, and not withheld from
exercising his powers that way by any respect of persons, his patched
cloak giving him the privilege of the ancient jester. To be a <i>gude
crack</i>, that is, to possess talents for conversation, was essential
to the trade of a 'puir body' of the more esteemed class; and Burns,
who delighted in the amusement their discourse afforded, seems to have
looked forward with gloomy firmness to the possibility of himself
becoming one day or other a member of their itinerant society. In his
poetical works, it is alluded to so often, as perhaps to indicate that
he considered the consummation as not utterly impossible. Thus, in the
fine dedication of his works to Gavin Hamilton, he says&mdash;
</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>  "And when I downa yoke a naig,</p>
<p>  Then, Lord be thankit, I can beg."</p>
</div></div>
<p>
Again, in his Epistle to Davie, a brother poet, he states, that in their
closing career&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>  "The last o't, the warst o't,</p>
<p class="i2"> Is only just to beg."</p>
</div></div>
<p>
And after having remarked, that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>  "To lie in kilns and barns at e'en,</p>
<p>  When banes are crazed and blude is thin,</p>
<p class="i2">Is doubtless great distress;"</p>
</div></div>
<p>
the bard reckons up, with true poetical spirit, the free enjoyment
of the beauties of nature, which might counterbalance the hardship
and uncertainty of the life even of a mendicant. In one of his prose
letters, to which I have lost the reference, he details this idea yet
more seriously, and dwells upon it, as not ill adapted to his habits
and powers.</p>
<p>
"As the life of a Scottish mendicant of the eighteenth century, seems to
have been contemplated without much horror by Robert Burns, the author
can hardly have erred in giving to Edie Ochiltree something of poetical
character and personal dignity, above the more abject of his miserable
calling. The class had, in fact, some privileges. A lodging, such as it
was, was readily granted to them in some of the outhouses, and the usual
<i>awmous</i> (alms) of a handful of meal (called a <i>gowpen</i>) was
scarce denied by the poorest cottager. The mendicant disposed of these,
according to their different quality, in various bags around his person,
and thus carried about with him the principal part of his sustenance,
which he literally received for the asking. At the houses of the gentry,
his cheer was mended by scraps of broken meat, and perhaps a Scottish
'twal-penny,' or English penny, which was expended in snuff or whisky.
In fact, these indolent peripatetics suffered much less real hardship
and want of food, than the poor peasants from whom they received alms.
</p><p>
"If, in addition to his personal qualifications, the mendicant chanced
to be a King's Bedesman, or Blue Gown, he belonged, in virtue thereof,
to the aristocracy of his order, and was esteemed a person of great
importance."
</p><p>
An extract then follows from an account of payments to "Blew Gownis," by
Sir Robert Melvill, of Murdocarney, treasurer-depute of King James VI.,
furnished to the author of "Waverley," by an officer of the Register
House; after which Sir Walter proceeds as follows:&mdash;
</p><p>
"I have only to add, that although the institution of King's Bedesmen
still subsists, they are now seldom to be seen
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page295" name="page295"></a>[pg 295]</span>
                                                in the streets of
Edinburgh, of which their peculiar dress made them rather a
characteristic feature.
</p><p>
"Having thus given an account of the genus and species to which Edie
Ochiltree appertains, the author may add, that the individual he had
in his eye was Andrew Gemmells, an old mendicant of the character
described, who was many years since well known, and must still be
remembered, in the vales of Gala, Tweed, Ettrick, Yarrow, and the
adjoining country.
</p><p>
"The author has in his youth repeatedly seen and conversed with Andrew,
but cannot recollect whether he held the rank of Blue Gown. He was a
remarkably fine old figure, very tall, and maintaining a soldier-like,
or military manner and address. His features were intelligent, with a
powerful expression of sarcasm. His motions were always so graceful,
that he might almost have been suspected of having studied them; for
he might, on any occasion, have served as a model for an artist, so
remarkably striking were his ordinary attitudes. Andrew Gemmells had
little of the cant of his calling; his wants were food and shelter, or a
trifle of money, which he always claimed, and seemed to receive, as his
due. He sang a good song, told a good story, and could crack a severe
jest with all the acumen of Shakspeare's jesters, though without using,
like them, the cloak of insanity. It was some fear of Andrew's satire,
as much as a feeling of kindness or charity, which secured him the
general good reception which he enjoyed every where. In fact, a jest of
Andrew Gemmells, especially at the expense of a person of consequence,
flew round the circle which he frequented, as surely as the bon-mot of
a man of established character for wit glides through the fashionable
world. Many of his good things are held in remembrance, but are
generally too local and personal to be introduced here.
</p><p>
"Andrew had a character peculiar to himself among his tribe, for aught
I ever heard. He was ready and willing to play at cards or dice with
any one who desired such amusement. This was more in the character of
the Irish itinerant gambler, called in that country a <i>carrow</i>,
than of the Scottish beggar. But the late Reverend Doctor Robert Douglas,
minister of Galashiels, assured the author, that the last time he saw
Andrew Gemmells, he was engaged in a game at brag with a gentleman of
fortune, distinction, and birth. To preserve the due gradations of rank,
the party was made at an open window of the château, the laird sitting
on his chair in the inside, the beggar on a stool in the yard; and they
played on the window-sill. The stake was a considerable parcel of
silver. The author expressing some surprise, Dr. Douglas observed, that
the laird was no doubt a humorist or original; but that many decent
persons in those times would, like him, have thought there was nothing
extraordinary in passing an hour, either in card-playing or
conversation, with Andrew Gemmells.
</p><p>
"This singular mendicant had generally, or was supposed to have, as much
money about his person, as would have been thought the value of his life
among modern footpads. On one occasion, a country gentleman, generally
esteemed a very narrow man, happening to meet Andrew, expressed great
regret that he had no silver in his pocket, or he would have given him
sixpence:&mdash;'I can give you change for a note laird,' replied Andrew.
</p><p>
"Like most who have arisen to the head of their profession, the modern
degradation which mendicity has undergone was often the subject of
Andrew's lamentations. As a trade, he said, it was forty pounds a year
worse since he had first practised it. On another occasion he observed,
begging was in modern times scarcely the profession of a gentleman, and
that if he had twenty sons, he would not easily be induced to breed one
of them up in his own line. When or where this <i>laudator temporis
acti</i> closed his wanderings, the author never heard with certainty;
but most probably, as Burns says&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<p>  "&mdash;&mdash;he died a cadger-powny's death</p>
<p class="i2">   At some dike side."</p>
</div></div>
<p>
"The author may add another picture of the same kind as Edie Ochiltree
and Andrew Gemmells; considering these illustrations as a sort of
gallery, open to the reception of any thing which may elucidate former
manners, or amuse the reader.
</p><p>
"The author's contemporaries at the university of Edinburgh will
probably remember the thin wasted form of a venerable old Bedesman, who
stood by the Potter-row Port, now demolished; and, without speaking a
syllable, gently inclined his head, and offered his hat, but with the
least possible Degree of urgency, towards each individual who passed.
This man gained, by silence and the extenuated and wasted appearance of
a palmer from a remote country, the same tribute which was yielded to
Andrew Gemmells's sarcastic humour and stately deportment. He was
understood
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page296" name="page296"></a>[pg 296]</span>
to be able to maintain a son a student in the theological
classics of the University, at the gate of which the father was a
mendicant. The young man was modest and inclined to learning, so that a
student of the same age, and whose parents were rather of the lower
order, moved by seeing him excluded from the society of other scholars
when the secret of his birth was suspected, endeavoured to console him
by offering him some occasional civilities. The old mendicant was
grateful for this attention to his son, and one day, as the friendly
student passed, he stooped forward more than usual, as if to intercept
his passage. The scholar drew out a halfpenny, which he concluded was
the beggar's object, when he was surprised to receive his thanks for the
kindness he had shown to Jemmie, and at the same time a cordial
invitation to dine with them next Sunday, 'on a shoulder of mutton and
potatoes,' adding, 'ye'll put on your clean sark, as I have company.'
The student was strongly tempted to accept of this hospitable proposal,
as many in his place would probably have done; but as the motive might
have been capable of misrepresentation, he thought it most prudent,
considering the character and circumstances of the old man, to decline
the invitation.
</p><p>
"Such are a few traits of Scottish mendicity, designed to throw light on
a novel in which a character of that description plays a prominent part.
We conclude, that we have vindicated Edie Ochiltree's right to the
importance assigned him; and have shown, that we have known one beggar
take a hand at cards with a person of distinction, and another give
dinner parties."
</p><p>
The curious reader who is anxious to pursue the character still further,
will be gratified with "a few particulars with which his biographer
appears to be unacquainted,"&mdash;by a Correspondent of the <i>Literary
Gazette</i>, No. 664.</p>

UNLUCKY TEXT.</h3>

<p>
Poor Dr. Sheridan, in an unguarded moment, but in as guiltless a spirit
as characterized the Vicar of Wakefield, chose for his text, upon the
anniversary of the succession of the House of Hanover, "Sufficient for
the day is the evil thereof." Although the sermon did not contain a
single political allusion that could have caused uneasiness, or should
have given offence, yet it was recorded in judgment against him, and
obstructed his preferment ever after.&mdash;<i>Southey's Colloquies</i>.

THE AMERICAN ALOE.</h3>

<div class="figure" style="width: 50%; float: right;">
 <a href="images/397-2.png"><img width="100%" src="images/397-2.png"
alt="The American Aloe." /></a>
 </div>


<p>
An American Aloe (<i>Agave Americana</i>) is one of the most superb
exhibitions in the whole vegetable kingdom. The plant, when vigorous,
rises upwards of twenty feet high, and branches out on every side,
forming a kind of pyramid, of greenish yellow flowers, in thick clusters
at every joint. We often meet with the aloe in our conservatories, and
it has been known to flourish in the open air. A Correspondent of the
<i>Gardener's Magazine</i>, writing from Gwrich Castle, Abergelay,
Denbighshire, tells us that "about eight years back he pulled down one
of his hot-houses, in which stood a large American Aloe, known to be 68
years of age. It was in a box about two feet square, and the plant was
so large that he determined not to put it in the new house then
building; it was, in consequence, placed alongside the south wall in the
corner (not expecting it to live,) where it has been ever since, never
having been watered in summer, nor matted nor attended to in winter, and
it is now as vigorous and as healthy (if not
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page297" name="page297"></a>[pg 297]</span>
                                             more so) than before. The
box was not buried in the ground, and is now falling to pieces. The
garden is about 100 yards from the sea."
</p><p>
It is no fable that the Aloe grows about a hundred years (a few more or
less) before it blooms; and, after yielding its seed, the stem withers
and dies. If we remember right, a beautiful specimen in full bloom, was
exhibited three or four years since at the Argyll Rooms, in Regent
Street.
</p><p>
It may be as well to mention that the sharp-pointed leaves have been
known to inflict serious injury. In the <i>Lancet</i>, No. 313, vol.
ii., a case is recorded of a young gardener, who whilst watering some
plants in a gentleman's garden, at Camberwell, accidentally struck his
hand against an aloe plant, one of the prickles of which passed into the
last joint of his lefthand little finger; he regarded the circumstance
at the time as but of trifling consequence, on account of its causing
him but slight inconvenience; neither were the effects worth notice
until two days after the accident, when the part put on a white
appearance, and the finger became very stiff, swollen, and painful;
these symptoms increased, and by the following morning the whole hand
and arm, as far as the elbow, had attained an exceedingly large size.
After suffering about two months, the poor fellow was removed into St.
Thomas's Hospital, where the diseased arm was amputated by Mr. Travers,
and the patient soon recovered his accustomed good health.
</p>
<hr/>

<h3>
MOLES.</h3>

<p>
In those districts where moles abound, it may be remarked that some
of the mole-hills are considerably larger than others. When a hill of
enlarged dimensions is thus discovered, we may be almost certain of
finding the nest, or den of the mole near it, by digging to a sufficient
depth. The fur of the mole is admirably adapted from its softness and
short close texture for defending the animal from subterraneous damp,
which is always injurious, more or less to non-amphibious animals; and
in this climate, no choice of situation could entirely guard against it.
It is a singular fact that there are no moles in Ireland. May not the
dampness of the climate account for their not thriving
there?&mdash;<i>Edinburgh Lit. Gaz.</i></p>

<hr/>

<h3>
CHANGES IN ANIMALS.</h3>

<p>
All domestic mammiferous animals introduced into America have become
more numerous than the indigenous animals. The hog multiplies very
rapidly, and assumes much of the character of the wild boar. Cows did
not at first thrive, but, in St. Domingo, only twenty-seven years after
its first discovery, 4,000 in a herd was not uncommon, and some herds of
8,000 are mentioned. In 1587, this island exported 35,444 hides, and New
Grenada 64,350. Cows never thrive nor multiply where salt is wanting
either in the plants or in the water. They give less milk in America,
and do not give milk at all if the calves be taken from them. Among
horses the colts have all the amble, as those in Europe have the trot:
this is probably a hereditary effect. Bright chestnut is the prevailing
colour among the wild horses. The lambs which are not from
<i>merinos</i>, but the <i>tana basta </i>and <i>burda</i> of the
Spaniards, at first are covered with wool, and when this is timely
shorn, it grows again; if the proper time is allowed to elapse, the wool
falls off, and is succeeded by short, shining, close hair, like that of
the goat in the same climate. Every animal, it would appear, like man,
requires time to accustom itself to climate.</p>

<hr/>

<h3>
THE GREAT AMERICAN BITTERN.</h3>

<p>
A most interesting and remarkable circumstance we learn from the
<i>Magazine of Natural History</i>, attends the great American Bittern;
it is that it has the power of emitting a light from its breast equal to
the light of a common torch, which illuminates the water so as to enable
it to discover its prey. As this circumstance is not mentioned by any
naturalist, the correspondent of the journal in question, took every
precaution to determine, as he has done, the truth of it.</p>

<h3>
BRITISH SEA SONGS.</h3>

<p>
One of our earliest naval ballads is derived from the Pepys Collection,
and is supposed to have been written in the reign of Queen Elizabeth.
It records the events of a sea-fight in the reign of Henry the Eighth,
between Lord Howard and Sir Andrew Barton, a Scotch pirate; and it is
rendered curious by the picture it presents of naval engagements in
those days, and by a singular fact which transpires in the course of
the details; namely, that the then maritime force of England consisted
of only <i>two ships of war</i>. In Percy's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page298" name="page298"></a>[pg 298]</span>
                                             "Reliques of Ancient
Poetry," there is another old marine ballad, called the "Winning of
<i>Cales</i>," a name which our sailors had given to Cadiz. This affair
took place in June, 1596; but the description of it in the old song
presents nothing peculiar, or worthy of attention as regards naval
manners. From this period, I cannot at present call to mind any sea song
of importance till Gay's "Black-eyed Susan," which, you know, has
maintained its popularity to the present hour, and which deserves to
have done so, no less on account of the beauty of the verses, than of
the pathetic air in the minor to which they are set. This was, at no
great length of time, succeeded by Stevens's "Storm," a song which, I
believe you will all allow, stands deservedly at the head of the lyrics
of the deep. The words are nautically correct, the music is of a manly
and original character, and the subject-matter is one of the most
interesting of the many striking incidents common to sea-life. These
fine ballads, if I mistake not, were succeeded by one or two popular
songs, with music by Dr. Arne; then came those of Dibdin, which were in
their turn followed by a host of compositions, distinguished more by the
strenuous, robust character of the music, than by poetical excellence,
or professional accuracy in the words. The songs in which the words
happened to be vigorous and true&mdash;(such, for example, as Cowper's noble
ballad called the "Castaway," and the "Loss of the Royal George,") were
not set to music; but the powers of Shield, Davy, and others, were
wasted on verses unworthy of their compositions. Among these, the
foremost in excellence is the "Arethusa," a composition on which the
singing of Incledon, and the bold, reckless, original John-Bull-like
character of the air by Shield, or ascribed to him, have fixed a high
reputation. Davy's "Bay of Biscay," deserves its popularity; and the
"Sailor Boy," "The Old Commodore," and one or two other melodies by
Reeve, (who, though not much of a musician, was an admirable melodist,)
abound also in the qualities which I have already alluded to, as
peculiar to the national music adapted to sea songs.&mdash;<i>Blackwood's
Magazine</i>.</p>

MAKING A BOOK.</h3>

<p>
Lady Morgan gives the following process by which her "Book of the
Boudoir" was manufactured: "While the fourth volume of the O'Briens,"
says her ladyship, "was going through the press, Mr. Colburn was
sufficiently pleased with the subscription (as it is called in the
trade) to the first edition, to desire a new work from the author. I was
just setting off for Ireland, the horses <i>literally</i> putting to,
[how curious!] when Mr. Colburn arrived with his flattering proposition.
[How <i>apropos</i>!] I could not enter into any future engagement; [how
awkward!] and Mr. Colburn taking up a scrabby MS. volume which the
servant was about to thrust into the pocket of the carriage, asked,
'What was that?' [How touchingly simple!] I said it was 'one of many
volumes of odds and ends <i>de omnibus rebus</i>;' and I read him the
last entry I had made the night before, on my return from the opera.
[How very obliging, considering that the horses were <i>literally</i>
put to!] 'This is the very thing!' said the 'European publisher;' [how
charming! and yet how droll!] and if the public is of the same opinion,
I shall have nothing to regret in thus coming, though somewhat in
<i>dishabillé</i>, before its tribunal."</p>

THE FEUDAL SYSTEM.</h3>

<p>
The system of servitude, which prevailed in the earlier periods of our
history was not of that unmitigated character that may be supposed. "No
man in those days could prey upon society, unless he were at war with it
as an outlaw&mdash;a proclaimed and open enemy. Rude as the laws were, the
purposes of law had not then been perverted;&mdash;it had not been made a
craft;&mdash;it served to deter men from committing crimes, or to punish them
for the commission;&mdash;never to shield notorious, acknowledged, impudent
guilt, from condign punishment. And in the fabric of society, imperfect
as it was, the outline and rudiments of what it ought to be were
distinctly marked in some main parts, where they are now wellnigh
utterly effaced. Every person had his place. There was a system of
superintendence
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page299" name="page299"></a>[pg 299]</span>
everywhere, civil as well us religious. They who were
born in villainage, were born to an inheritance of labour, but not of
inevitable depravity and wretchedness. If one class were regarded in
some respects as cattle, they were at least taken care of; they were
trained, fed, sheltered, and protected; and there was an eye upon them
when they strayed. None were wild, unless they were wild wilfully, and
in defiance of control. None were beneath the notice of the priest, nor
placed out of the possible reach of his instruction and his care. But
how large a part of your population are, like the dogs of Lisbon and
Constantinople, unowned, unbroken to any useful purpose, subsisting by
chance or by prey; living in filth, mischief, and wretchedness; a
nuisance to the community while they live, and dying miserably at
last!"&mdash;<i>Ibid</i>.</p>

How wondrous is the science of mechanism! how variegated its progeny,
how simple, yet how compound! I am propelled to the consideration of
this subject by having optically perceived that ingenious nautical
instrument, which has just now flown along like a mammoth, that monster
of the deep! You ask me how are steam-boats propagated? in other words,
how is such an infinite and immovable body inveigled along its course? I
will explain it to you. It is by the power of friction; that is to say,
the two wheels, or paddles turning diametrically, or at the same moment,
on their axioms, and repressing by the rotundity of their motion the
action of the menstruum in which the machine floats,&mdash;water being, in
a philosophical sense, a powerful non-conductor,&mdash;it is clear, that in

<h3>
LAWS FOR THE POOR.</h3>

<p>
Every civilized state in the world, except Ireland, has prevented the
extortion of the landlords, by institutions, either springing from the
nature of society, or established by positive legal enactments.
</p><p>
In Austria, great exertions are made for the poor.&mdash;Vide "Reisbeck's
Travels through Germany," p. 79; and "Este's Journey," p. 337.
</p><p>
In Bavaria, there are laws obliging each community to maintain its own
poor.&mdash;Vide "Count Rumford's Establishment of Poor in Bavaria," chap. 1.
</p><p>
In Protestant Germany they are even better provided for.&mdash;Vide
"Henderson's Tour in Germany," p. 74.
</p><p>
In Russia, the aged and infirm are provided with food and raiment by
law, at the expense of the owner of the estate.&mdash;"Clarke's Travels in
Russia." For others who may want, there is a college of provision in
each government.&mdash;"Took's Russian Empire," vol. ii. p. 181.
</p><p>
In Livonia and Poland, the lord is bound by law to provide for the
serf.&mdash;Vide "Bavarian Transactions," vol. iii.
</p><p>
In Northern Italy and Sicily, the crop is equally divided between
landlord and tenant.&mdash;Vide "Sismondi's Italy." And the revenues of the
church support the poor.
</p><p>
In imperial France, though the land had been divided by an Agrarian law,
and cultivated, yet the Octroi, with other revenues, were devoted to the
poor.
</p><p>
In Hungary, though feudal slavery gives an interest to the lord of the
soil in the life of his serf, yet the law insists upon the provision of
food, raiment and shelter. In Switzerland, though the Agrarian law is in
force, and the governments purchase corn to keep down the retail prices,
yet there is a provision for the poor.&mdash;Vide "Sismondi's Switzerland,"
vol. 1. p. 452. In Norway there is a provision for the poor.&mdash;Clarke's
"Scandinavia," p. 637.
</p><p>
In Sweden, the most moral country in the world, the poor are maintained
in the same manner as in England; a portion of the parochial assessment
is devoted by law to education.&mdash;James's "Tour through Sweden," p. 105.
</p><p>
In Flanders there are permanent funds, &amp;c. for the sustentation of the
poor. Vide Radcliff's "Report on the Agriculture of Flanders." And there
are in the Netherlands seven great workhouses.
</p><p>
The Dutch poor laws do not differ much from our own.&mdash;-Vide Macfarlan's
"Inquiries concerning the Poor," p. 218.
</p><p>
Even in Iceland, there is a provision for the poor.&mdash;Vide Han's
"Iceland." Also in Denmark.&mdash;Vide p. 292, Jacob's
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page300" name="page300"></a>[pg 300]</span>
"Tracts on the Corn
Laws." In America there are poor laws.&mdash;Vide Dr. Dwight's "Travels,"
vol. iv. p. 326. In Scotland the English system is rapidly extending;
and where the poor laws are not introduced, there are a great many of
the miseries which are found in Ireland.&mdash;Vide "Evidence of A. Nimmo,
Esq. before the Lords' Committee on Ireland, 1824." This gentleman
thinks, that if they had been earlier introduced, Scotland would be now
a richer country. He also states, that the average expense of supporting
idle mendicants in Ireland, exceeds one million and a half annually, by
the contribution of more than a ton of potatoes from each farm house, to
encourage a system of licentious idleness, profligacy, insolence, and
plunder; and the grand jury presentments amount annually to a
million.&mdash;<i>Monthly Mag</i>.</p>

In Turkey, nailing by the ears is an operation performed on bakers, for
selling light bread. There is a hole cut in the door for the back of
the culprit's head; the ears are then nailed to the panel; he is left
in this position till sunset, then released; and seldom sustains any
permanent injury from the punishment, except in his reputation. Perjury
is an offence which is so little thought of, that it is visited with
the mildest of all their punishments. The offender is set upon an ass,
with his face to the tail, and a label on his back, with the term
<i>scheat</i> or perjurer. In this way he is led about to the great
amusement of the multitude, and even of his associates.</p>

SCHOOL DAYS.</h3>

Linnaeus long retained an unpleasant recollection of his school days;<a id="footnotetag5" name="footnotetag5"></a><a href="#footnote5"><sup>5</sup></a>
it is common to call this period of human life, a happy one, but that
existence must have been very wretched, of which, the time passed at
school has been the happiest part; it is sufficiently apparent even
to superficial observers that the mind cannot, in early life, be
sufficiently matured for high enjoyment; the most exquisite of our

<h3>
AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF A LANDAULET!</h3>

<p>
I dined one day at a bachelor's dinner in Lincoln's Inn-fields, and my
wife having no engagement that evening, I gave my coachman a half
holiday, and when he had set me down, desired him to put up his horses,
as I should return home in a jarvey. At eleven, my conveyance arrived;
the steps were let down, and, when down, they slanted under the body of
the carriage; my foot slipped from the lowest step, and I grazed my shin
against the second; but at last I surmounted the difficulty, and seating
myself, sank back upon the musty, fusty, ill-savoured squabs of the
jarvey.
</p><p>
I was about to undertake a very formidable journey; I lived in the
Regent's Park; and as the horses that now drew me had been worked hard
during the day, it seemed probable that some hours would elapse before I
could reach my own door. Off they went, however; the coachman urged them
on with whip and tongue: the body of the jarvey swung to and fro; the
glasses shook and clattered; the straw on the floor felt damp, and rain
water oozed through the roof, (for it was a landaulet). I felt chilled,
and drew up the front window, at least I drew up the frame; but as it
contained no glass, I was not the warmer for my pains; so I wrapped my
cloak around me, and rather sulkily sank into a reverie. The vehicle
still continued to rumble, and rattle, and shake, and squeak; I fell
into a doze, caused by some fatigue and much claret, and gradually these
sounds seemed to soften into a voice! I distinguished intelligible
accents! I listened attentively to the low murmurs, and distinctly I
heard, and treasured in my memory, what appeared to me to be the "Lament
of the Landaulet!"
</p><p>
The poor <i>body</i> seemed to sigh, and the wheels became
<i>spokesmen</i>!
</p><p>
"I am about fifteen years of age," (thus squeaked my equipage); "I was
born in Long Acre, the birthplace of the aristocracy of my race, and
Messrs. Houlditch were my parents.
</p><p>
"No four-wheeled carriage could possibly have entered upon life with
brighter prospects; it is, alas! my hard lot to detail the vicissitudes
that rendered me what I am.
</p><p>
"I was ordered by an earl, who was on the point of marriage with an
heiress, and I was fitted up in the most expensive style. My complexion
was pale
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page301" name="page301"></a>[pg 301]</span>
         yellow; on my sides I had coronets and supporters; my inside
was soft and comfortable; my rumble behind was satisfactory; and my
dicky was perfection, and provided with a hammercloth. My boots were
capacious, my pockets were ample, and my leathers in good condition.
</p><p>
"When I stood at the earl's door on the morning of his marriage, it was
admitted by all who beheld me, that a neater <i>turn-out</i> had never
left Long Acre. Lightly did my noble possessor press my cushions, as I
wafted him to St. George's Church, Hanover Square; and when the ceremony
was over, and the happy pair sat side by side within me, the earl kissed
the lips of his countess, and I felt proud, not of the rank and wealth
of my contents, but because they were contented and happy.
</p><p>
"Oh, how merrily my wheels whirled in those days! I bore my possessors
to their country-seat; I flew about the county returning wedding visits;
I went to races, with sandwiches and champagne in my pockets; and I
spent many a long night in the inn-yard, while my lord and lady were
presiding at county assemblies.
</p><p>
"Mine was a life of sunshine and smiles. But ladies are capricious: the
countess suddenly discovered that I was heavy. Now, if she wished me to
be light-headed, why did she order a landaulet? She declared, too, that
I was unfit for town service; gave new orders to Houlditch; took
possession of a chariot fashioned eight months later than myself; sent
me to Long Acre to be disposed of, and I became a secondhand article!
</p><p>
"My humiliation happened at an unlucky moment, for continual racketing
in the country had quite unhinged me; I required bracing, and had quite
lost my colour. My paternal relation, however, (Houlditch), undertook my
repair, and I was very soon exhibited painted green, and ticketed, 'For
sale secondhand.'
</p><p>
"It was now the month of May, when all persons of the smallest
fashionable pretensions shun their country abodes and come to London,
that they may escape the first fragrance of the flowers, the first song
of the birds, the budding beauty of the forests and the fresh verdure of
the fields. I therefore felt (as young unmarried ladies feel at the
commencement of the season) that there was every chance of my finding a
lord and master, and becoming a prominent ornament of his establishment.
</p><p>
"After standing for a month at Houlditch's, (who, by the by, was not
over-civil to his own child, but made a great favour of giving me
house-room), I one day found myself scrutinized by a gentleman of very
fashionable appearance. He was in immediate want of a carriage; I was,
fortunately, exactly the sort of carriage he required, and in a quarter
of an hour the transfer was arranged.
</p><p>
"The gentleman was on the point of running away with a young lady;
<i>he</i> was attached to <i>her</i>, four horses were attached to
<i>me</i>, and I was in waiting at the corner of Grosvenor Street at
midnight. I thought myself a fortunate vehicle; I anticipated another
marriage, another matrimonial trip, another honeymoon. Alas! my present
trip was not calculated to add to my respectability. My owner, who was a
military man, was at his post at the appointed time: he seemed hurried
and agitated; frequently looked at his watch; paced rapidly before one
of the houses, and continually looked towards the drawing-room windows.
At length a light appeared, the window was opened, and a female, muffled
in a cloak and veil, stood on the balcony; she leaned anxiously forward;
he spoke, and without replying she re-entered the room. The street-door
opened, and a brisk little waiting-maid came out with some bundles,
which she deposited in the carriage: the captain (for such was his rank)
had entered the hall, and he now returned, bearing in his arms a
fainting, weeping woman; he placed her by his side in the carriage: my
rumble was instantly occupied by the waiting-maid and my master's man,
and we drove off rapidly towards Brighton.
</p><p>
"The captain was a man of fashion; handsome, insinuating, profligate,
and unfeeling. The lady&mdash;it is painful to speak of her: what she
<i>had</i> been, she could never more be; and what she then was, she
herself had yet to learn. She had been the darling pet daughter of a
rich old man; and a dissipated nobleman had married her for her money
when she was only sixteen. She had been accustomed to have every wish
gratified by her doting parent; she now found herself neglected and
insulted by her husband. Her father could not bear to see his darling's
once-smiling face grow pale and sad, and he died two years after her
marriage. She plunged into the whirlpool of dissipation, and tasted the
rank poisons which are so often sought as the remedies for a sad heart.
From folly she ran to imprudence; from imprudence to guilt;&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page302" name="page302"></a>[pg 302]</span>
 was
the runaway wife happier than she who once suffered unmerited ill-usage
at home? Time will show.
</p><p>
"At Brighton, my wheels rattled along the cliffs as briskly and as
loudly as the noblest equipage there; but no female turned a glance of
recognition towards my windows, and the eyes of former friends were
studiously averted. I bore my lady through the streets, and I waited for
her now and then at the door of the theatre; but at gates of
respectability, at balls, and at assemblies, I, alas! was never
'called,' and never 'stopped the way.' Like a disabled soldier, I ceased
to bear <i>arms</i>, and I was <i>crest</i>-fallen!
</p><p>
"This could not last: my mistress could little brook contempt,
especially when she felt it to be deserved; her cheek lost its bloom,
her eye its lustre; and when her beauty became less brilliant, she no
longer possessed the only attraction which had made the captain her
lover. He grew weary of her, soon took occasion to quarrel with her, and
she was left without friends, without income, and without character.
I was at length torn from her: it nearly broke my springs to part with
her; but I was despatched to the bazaar in London, and saw no more of
my lady.

<h3>
FASHIONABLE NOVELS.</h3>

<p>
It is well that hard words break no bones, else two or three gentlemen
of literary notoriety would be in a sorry plight after reading the
following passage in a recent <i>Magazine</i>. We stand by, and like
the fellow in the play, bite our thumb:&mdash;
</p><p>
"Surely, surely, all men, women, and children, not cursed with the
fatuity that would become a vice-president of the Phrenological Society,
must by this time be about heartsick of what are called Novels of
Fashionable Life. Only two men of any pretensions to superiority of
talent have had part in the uproarious manufacture of this ware, that
has been dinned in our ears by trumpet after trumpet, during the last
six or seven years. Mr. Theodore Hook began the business&mdash;a man of such
strong native sense and thorough knowledge of the world as it is, that
we cannot doubt the <i>coxcombry</i> which has drawn so much derision on
his <i>sayings</i> and <i>doings</i> was all, to use a phrase which he
himself has brought into fashion, <i>humbug</i>. He could not cast his
keen eyes over any considerable circle of society in this country,
without perceiving the melancholy fact, that the British nation labours
under a universal mania for gentility&mdash;all the world hurrying and
bustling in the same idle chase&mdash;good honest squires and baronets, with
pedigrees of a thousand years, and estates of ten thousand acres&mdash;ay,
and even noble lords&mdash;yea, the noblest of the noble themselves (or at
least their ladies), rendered fidgety and uncomfortable by the
circumstance of their not somehow or other belonging to one particular
little circle in London. Comely round-paunched parsons and squireens,
again, all over the land, eating the bread of bitterness, and drinking
the waters of sorrow, because they are, or think they are, tipt the cold
shoulder by these same honest squires and baronets, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c. who,
excluded from Almack's, in their own fair turn and rural sphere enact
nevertheless, with much success, the part of <i>exclusives</i>&mdash;and so
downwards&mdash;down to the very verge of dirty linen. The obvious facility
of practising lucratively on this prevailing folly&mdash;of raising
700<i>l</i>., 1000<i>l</i>., or 1500<i>l</i>. per <i>series</i>, merely
by cramming the mouths of the asinine with mock-majestic details of fine
life&mdash;this found favour with an indolent no less than sagacious
humorist; and the fatal example was set. Hence the vile and most
vulgar pawings of such miserables as Messrs. Vivian Grey and "The
Roué"&mdash;creatures who betray in every page, which they stuff full of
Marquess and My Lady, that their own manners are as gross as they make
it their boast to show their morals. Hence, some two or three pegs
higher, and not more, are such very very fine scoundrels as the Pelhams,
&amp;c.; shallow, watery-brained, ill-taught, effeminate dandies&mdash;animals
destitute apparently of one touch of real manhood, or of real
passion&mdash;cold, systematic, deliberate debauchees, withal&mdash;seducers, God
wot! and duellists, and, above all, philosophers! How could any human
being be gulled by such flimsy devices as these?
</p><p>
"These gentry form a sort of cross between the Theodorian breed of novel
and the Wardish&mdash;the extravagantly overrated&mdash;the heavy, imbecile,
pointless, but still well-written, sensible, and, we may even add, not
disagreeable, Tremaine and De Vere. The second of these books was a mere
<i>rifacimento</i> of the first; and, fortunately for what remained of
his reputation, Mr. Robert Ward has made no third attempt. He has much
to answer for; <i>e.g.</i> if we were called upon to point out the most
disgusting abomination to be found in the whole range of contemporary
literature,
<span class="pagenum"><a id="page303" name="page303"></a>[pg 303]</span>
we have no hesitation in saying we should feel it our duty
to lay our finger on the Bolingbroke-<i>Balaam</i> of that last and
worst of an insufferable charlatan's productions&mdash;<i>Devereux</i>.</p>

<h3>
BRUSSELS IN 1829.</h3>

<p>
For the education of youth of both sexes, Brussels is one of the best
stations on the continent, and is a good temporary residence for
Englishmen whose means are limited. The country is plentiful, and
consequently every article of living moderate. It is near England, the
government is mild, and there is no restraint in importing English
books, though their own press is any thing but free.
</p><p>
The population of Brussels is rated at nearly 100,000, of which
above 20,000 are paupers, supported by the government and voluntary
contributions. The population is rapidly increasing. The number of
foreigners in the winter of 1828 was between seven and eight thousand,
of which half the number were English. Many families settle for a
season, and take their flight south, or return home in June; but the
greatest number are stationary for the education of their children. An
English clergyman, formerly a teacher at Harrow, has an establishment
for boys, well conducted, and the expense does not exceed fifty guineas
a year. There are several seminaries for girls, also superintended by
Englishwomen, with French teachers. Masters in every department are
excellent, so that few places afford better schools for education.
</p><p>
The air in the upper part of the city is salubrious, and the climate,
perhaps, better on the whole than England; but the winters are sharper,
and the summers hotter; fogs are less frequent, and the spring generally
sets in a fortnight earlier than in any part of Great Britain.
</p><p>
Our countrymen will be disappointed who settle in Brussels as a place of
amusement, for no capital can be more dull; and the natives are not
ready of access, which is probably as much the fault of their visitors
as themselves. As a station for economy, it can be highly recommended,
provided no trust is put in servants, and every thing is paid for with
ready money. The writer of this article resided in Brussels for a dozen
years, and he knows this from experience. If an establishment, large
or small, is well regulated, a saving of fifty per cent, may be made,
certainly, in housekeeping, compared with London. House-rent is dearer
in proportion with other articles of living, and the taxes are daily
augmenting. The horse-tax is more than double that of England; and the
king of the Netherlands can boast that he is the only sovereign in
Europe who has a tax on female labour. William Pitt attempted a similar
measure, but was mobbed by the housemaids, and abandoned it.&mdash;<i>New

Lysons in his "Environs of London," says, "In a room adjoining to the

Lord Downe is said to have seen in it a robbery committed on Blackheath;

Galloway is a county in Scotland that lies the most to the south and

of horses of a middling size, which are strong, active, hardy, and
serviceable.
</p><p>
Tradition reports that this kind of horse sprung from some Spanish
stallions, who swam on shore from some of the ships of the famous
Spanish Armada wrecked on the coast.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
